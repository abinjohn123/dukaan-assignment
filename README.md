## My Approach

### IDE & Hosting

Created with CodeSandbox. Hosted on Netlify.

### Initial set up

I started by analyzing the design file and splitting it into various sections.

- Header
- Main
- Features
- Other Products
- Footer

Each section has been turned into its dedicated component to modularize the code.

### Building the page

The layouts have been built using a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid. Flexbox has been used where multiple elements are to be positioned on the same row, while Grid has been used where elements are to be places across multiple rows. Using Flexbox and Grid will help in making the design responsive should that be required in the future.

The floating effect for the `main` section has been achieved using the CSS `transform: translate()` property.
